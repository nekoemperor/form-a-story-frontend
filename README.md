## Off-Platform Project: Form a Story (from CodeCademy)

In this project, I built a simple interactive website with HTML/CSS/JavaScript.

### This website's description:

Forms are great for collecting information on users, like job applications or insightful surveys. However, we can also stretch our creative muscles and have a little fun with forms. For this project, I used my knowledge of the HTML <form> and grab user input to put a spin on a classic story!

The logic for parsing and inserting of user inputs is already taken care of in main.js using JavaScript. Iâ€™ve also added some styling to the page in style.css.
